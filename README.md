extendscript-bundlr
===================

A tool for bundling Adobe ExtendScripts that use the `//@include 'path/to/file'` or `#include 'path/to/file'` statement.

Still a Work in Progress.  


### Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)  

### Limitations

This tool currently only parses one file. There is no recursive parsing. You could parse the bundled file again though.  

### Install

global:  

    npm install extendscript-bundlr -g

local (not yet tested):  

    npm install extendscript-bundlr --save-dev  


### Usage

global:  

    exsbundlr --source path/to/input.js --target path/to/output.js

or

    exsbundlr -s path/to/input.js -t path/to/output.js

local:  

    ./node_modules/.bin/exsbundlr --source path/to/input.js --target path/to/output.js

You can omit the target

    exsbundlr -s path/to/input.js

This will output to a file called "exsbundlr.default.bundle.jsx"



### Todo

- [x] parse `//@include 'path/to/file'`
- [x] Also parse `#include 'path/to/file'`
- [x] Also parse `#includepath`
- [x] Also parse `@include path/to/file` (without quotes works. grrrr)
- [x] Also parse `#include path/to/file` (without quotes works. grrrr)
- [ ] Add watch function

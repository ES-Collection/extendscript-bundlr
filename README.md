extendscript-bundlr
===================

A tool for bundling Adobe ExtendScripts that use the `//@include 'path/to/file'` statement.


Still a Work in Progress


### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- 

### Limitations

This tool currently only parses one file. There is no recursive parsing. You could reparse the bundled file though.  

### Install

global:  

    npm install extendsript-bundlr -g

local (not yet tested):  

    npm install extendsript-bundlr --save-dev  


### Usage

global:  

    exsbundlr --source path/to/input.js --target path/to/output.js

or

    exsbundlr -s path/to/input.js -t path/to/output.js

local:  

    ./node_modules/.bin/exsbundlr --source path/to/input.js --target path/to/output.js

You can omit the target

    exsbundlr -s path/to/input.js

This will output to a file called "exsbundlr.default.bundle.jsx"



### Todo

- Also parse `#include 'path/to/file'`
